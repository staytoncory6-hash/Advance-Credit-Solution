RE: Identity Theft – Request for Investigation and Removal of Fraudulent Information

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to dispute and report items on my credit file that are the direct result of identity theft. I did not open the accounts or authorize the inquiries listed below.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), including 15 U.S.C. § 1681c-2 and related sections, I am requesting that you conduct a thorough investigation, block the fraudulent information, and remove any accounts or inquiries that you determine to be the result of identity theft.

The items in question are:

• Creditor / Company Name:
  Account Number (last four digits): ****
  Type of account: [e.g., credit card, loan]
  Reason: Identity theft – I did not open this account.

• Creditor / Company Name:
  Account Number (last four digits): ****
  Type of account: [e.g., collection]
  Reason: Identity theft – I did not authorize this.

In support of my claim, I have enclosed:

• A copy of my government-issued ID
• Proof of my current address
• A copy of my credit report with the fraudulent items highlighted
• A copy of my FTC Identity Theft report
• A copy of the police report related to this identity theft (if available)
• Any relevant correspondence from creditors regarding these accounts

Please complete your investigation and provide me with written confirmation of the actions taken. If you determine that the items are indeed fraudulent, I request that they be removed from my credit file and that you send an updated copy of my credit report to me.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

RE: Dispute of Inaccurate / Incomplete Information under the FCRA

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to dispute the accuracy and completeness of certain information on my credit report. This letter is a formal request for an investigation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), including 15 U.S.C. § 1681i and related provisions.

The following items appear to be inaccurate, incomplete, or cannot be verified:

• Creditor / Company Name:
  Account Number (last four digits): ****
  Reason for dispute: [e.g., payment history is reported late, but was paid on time / balance is not correct / account does not belong to me / account is duplicated, etc.]
  Requested action: [e.g., update to “paid on time,” correct the balance, or delete the account if it cannot be verified.]

• Creditor / Company Name:
  Account Number (last four digits): ****
  Reason for dispute: [brief explanation]
  Requested action: [correction or deletion requested]

I have enclosed:

• A copy of my government-issued ID
• Proof of my current address
• A copy of my credit report with the disputed items highlighted
• Any supporting documentation (statements, letters, receipts, etc.) that support my position

Please conduct a reasonable investigation of each disputed item and update or remove any information that is inaccurate, incomplete, or cannot be verified as required by the FCRA.

Once your investigation is complete, please send me a written response and an updated copy of my credit report reflecting any changes made.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

RE: Request to Remove Unauthorized / Inaccurate Hard Inquiry

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to dispute the following hard inquiry(ies) on my credit report that I do not recognize or did not authorize.

The inquiry information is as follows:

• Company Name:
  Date of Inquiry: [MM/DD/YYYY]
  Reason for dispute: I did not apply for credit with this company and did not authorize this inquiry.

• Company Name:
  Date of Inquiry: [MM/DD/YYYY]
  Reason for dispute: [if there is another unauthorized or clearly incorrect inquiry]

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I am requesting that you investigate these inquiries. If the companies listed cannot provide proof that I authorized the inquiry(ies), I request that they be removed from my credit file.

Enclosed you will find:

• A copy of my government-issued ID
• Proof of my current address
• A copy of my credit report with the disputed inquiry(ies) highlighted

Please complete your investigation and provide me with a written response. If you determine that the inquiry(ies) were unauthorized or cannot be verified, I request that you delete them from my credit report and provide an updated copy reflecting the changes.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
