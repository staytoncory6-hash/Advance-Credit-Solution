          <li>Group similar issues together (all medical, all old collections, all late payments, etc.).</li>
          <li>Choose the easiest or most obviously inaccurate items to dispute first to build momentum.</li>
          <li>Create a folder (physical or digital) for letters, reports, envelopes, and responses.</li>
          <li>Track mailing dates, certified mail numbers, and response deadlines in one simple log.</li>

        <h2>AI Credit Survival Guide (Preview)</h2>
        <p>A small preview of your AI-powered credit survival guide.</p>

        <h3>What It Teaches</h3>
        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>How to read your credit reports without freezing or panicking</li>
          <li>Which laws actually matter for real, everyday situations</li>
          <li>How to build a “snapshot” so you always know where you stand</li>
          <li>How to choose the next best step instead of guessing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preview Section: The Snapshot Method</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of trying to fix everything at once, you create one clear page
          that shows your current situation:
        </p>

        <ul class="detail-list">
          <li>How many collections</li>
          <li>How many charge-offs</li>
          <li>How many late payments</li>
          <li>Your utilization &amp; positive history</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When you see everything on one page, your credit stops feeling like a mystery.
          You can make a calm plan instead of reacting out of fear.
        </p>

        <p>
          The full guide goes deeper into letters, timelines, tracking, and how to
          work with — not against — the system while protecting yourself.
