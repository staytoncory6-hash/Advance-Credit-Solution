    <!-- BASIC DISPUTE STARTER -->
    <section class="fr-section">
      <h2>Where Do I Even Start With Disputes?</h2>
      <p>
        If you’ve never done a dispute before, it can feel overwhelming. Here’s a simple, honest way
        to think about it:
      </p>
      <ol class="fr-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Pull all three reports:</strong> Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. You can use
          AnnualCreditReport.com or a monitoring service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Highlight the problems:</strong> late payments, collections, charge-offs,
          bankruptcies, wrong personal info, duplicated accounts, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decide what to dispute first:</strong> focus on things that are inaccurate,
          incomplete, or can’t be verified — not just “things you don’t like.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Write it down clearly:</strong> who the creditor is, what’s wrong, and what you
          want fixed (corrected, deleted, updated).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Send it in writing:</strong> letter, proof, and a copy of the report with
          the items highlighted.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This is just the beginning. Our <strong>Elite Membership</strong> goes much deeper with
        step-by-step guidance, advanced letters, and proper mailing etiquette that can make all
        the difference.

    <!-- SOFT TEASE FOR MAILING ETIQUETTE -->
    <section class="fr-section">
      <h2>The Truth About Mailing Disputes</h2>
      <p>
        Most people just write a letter, slap on a stamp, and hope for the best. That’s how good
        disputes end up getting lost in the shuffle of automated systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a smarter way to mail disputes that forces more human review and makes your hard
        work actually count. Because of how powerful this strategy is, the full
        <strong>Proper Mailing Etiquette System</strong> is reserved for members only.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re serious about winning with your credit, the way you mail your letters is just as
        important as what your letters say.

    <!-- WHY YOU CARE / HEART -->
    <section class="fr-section fr-heart">
      <h2>Why I Offer Free Resources At All</h2>
      <p>
        I know how hard life can hit. I know what it feels like to be told “no” over and over again.
        I also know how powerful good credit is when you finally take control of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        These free resources exist because I don’t believe help should only be available to people
        who can swipe a card on day one. You deserve at least a place to start — real information,
        not just sales talk.
      </p>
      <p>
        If all you ever do is use the free tools on this site and it helps you fix something on your
        credit, that means the world to me. If you choose to become a member later, we’ll go even
        deeper together.
