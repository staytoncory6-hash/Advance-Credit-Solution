            We know credit is more than a number. It’s cars, homes, kids, safety, and the power
            to say “yes” when life gives you a chance. Elite AI Credit Repair walks with you,
            step by step, using the law and real strategy — not fear.

        <h2>Why This Matters So Much to Us</h2>
        <p>
          We’ve seen what bad credit does to good people. Being denied for a car, paying double
          for basic things, feeling embarrassed to even open your mail — it’s heavy. This isn’t
          about judging you. It’s about helping you get your dignity, options, and peace of mind back.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why we built Elite AI Credit Repair: to mix powerful tools with real heart.
          We use the law, dispute strategy, and smart planning — but we never forget there’s
          a real person and a real family behind every credit report.

        <h2>How Elite AI Credit Repair Works</h2>

        <ol class="how-list">
          <li>
            <strong>1. Get Clear on Your Situation</strong><br />
            You pull all three reports. We help you spot what’s wrong, what’s old, what’s missing,
            and what’s just plain unfair.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Build a Game Plan, Not Just Random Letters</strong><br />
            We use snapshots, timelines, and real dispute strategy so you’re not just throwing
            letters at the wall hoping something sticks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Take Action and Adjust With Life</strong><br />
            As you get responses and life changes, we adjust the plan. Progress, not perfection.
            We care more about your next right step than your past mistakes.
          </li>
