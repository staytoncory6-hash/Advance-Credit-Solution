          <p>
            This is for people who don’t just want a one-time Snapshot. They want a
            guided, round-by-round system with letters, escalation, and smart tracking
            – without paying some giant company a small fortune.
          </p>
          <p>
            You bring the story. Elite AI brings the plan, letters, and structure.

          <h3>What Membership Includes</h3>
          <p>
            Membership is built around <strong>rounds</strong> – not random letters.
            Each round has a clear purpose and a calm, law-based strategy.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Round 1 – Initial Disputes:</strong> Clean, direct bureau letters based on your Snapshot and story.</li>
            <li><strong>Round 2 – Follow-Up:</strong> Second pass on anything not corrected, with more detail and pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Round 3 – Method of Verification:</strong> Deeper questions about how they verified and are reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Round 4 – Regulator Escalation:</strong> Complaint language aimed at CFPB, FTC, and state Attorney General when needed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Elite AI helps shape the <strong>intros and structure</strong> of these rounds
            from your story. You’re never just guessing what to send next.

        <h2>How the Rounds System Works</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Think of this like a calm, structured fight plan. No rage. No nonsense.
          Just a sequence that moves from “asking nicely” to “bringing in regulators”
          if they refuse to follow the law.
        </p>

            <h3>Round 1 – Clean Initial Disputes</h3>
            <p>
              Based on your Snapshot and story, Elite AI helps you shape your first
              round of letters to the bureaus. The goal: correct, incomplete, or
              unverified data – no fluff, no fake laws.

          <article class="step-card">
            <h3>Round 2 – Follow-Up Pressure</h3>
            <p>
              If some items come back “verified” or ignored, Round 2 goes a level
              deeper. More detail, more clarity, and a stronger reminder of your
              rights under the FCRA.

          <article class="step-card">
            <h3>Round 3 – Method of Verification</h3>
            <p>
              Here we start asking how they verified, what procedures they used,
              and why obviously bad data is still being reported. This round is
              about the process, not just the result.

            <h3>Round 4 – Regulator Escalation</h3>
            <p>
              If bureaus or furnishers keep stonewalling, it may be time to bring
              in outside eyes: CFPB, FTC, state Attorney General, and other
              regulators. This is escalation, not anger.

            Most “AI credit repair” you see is just template letters with a new label.

            your story and keeps moving forward with you.
