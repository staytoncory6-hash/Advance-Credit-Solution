    <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
    <section class="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why This Matters So Much</h2>

      <p>
        Credit isn’t just a score. It’s not just bureaus, reports, or disputes.
        Credit is <strong>your life story</strong> — the opportunities you get, the stability you
        build, and the freedom to take care of your family when they need you most.
      </p>

      <p>
        I care so deeply about this because I know what it feels like to fight through hell, survive
        something life-changing, and still want to help others rise higher than before.
        That’s why this membership exists: because I want you to win.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing makes me happier than seeing someone get approved for their first home, their dream
        car, or finally having an emergency credit card when life throws something unexpected at them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When life looks at you and says “no,” we help you look back and say <strong>“YES.”</strong>
