            This is where the free Ask AI turns into a full system. You bring your messy,
            real-life credit situation. We give you structure: a snapshot, dispute packets,
            templates, and a dashboard so you always know what’s going on.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-note">
            Anything deeper than the free Ask AI lives here — inside the membership.

        <h2>What Your Membership Actually Includes</h2>

        <div class="benefits-layout">
          <div>
            <h3>1. Mailing Etiquette &amp; Complete Packets</h3>
            <p>
              We don’t just say “send a letter.” We show you what a complete
              <strong>dispute packet</strong> looks like:
            </p>
            <ul class="benefits-list">
              <li>Exactly what to put in your packet (ID, proof of address, reports, evidence)</li>
              <li>How to label and organize everything so bureaus take you seriously</li>
              <li>Why registered / certified mail matters and when to use it</li>
              <li>How to keep copies and track delivery so nothing “mysteriously” disappears</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Dispute Letters &amp; Examples</h3>
            <ul class="benefits-list">
              <li>Examples of proper dispute letters written in real language</li>
              <li>Letters for inaccurate accounts, late payments, and balance errors</li>
              <li>Reinsertion letters when deleted items come back</li>
              <li>Identity theft dispute formats and what to attach</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Identity Theft &amp; “What Happened to Me” Overview</h3>
            <ul class="benefits-list">
              <li>Step-by-step identity theft workflow if accounts were opened in your name</li>
              <li>How to document your story so it’s clear and believable</li>
              <li>How to use police reports, FTC reports, and regulators the smart way</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="membership-note-card">
            <h3>4. The Dashboard &amp; Snapshot</h3>
            <p>
              You’ll have a simple dashboard to track:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which accounts you’ve disputed and when</li>
              <li>What each bureau responded with</li>
              <li>Score changes and major milestones</li>
              <li>Next letters and next steps</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="hero-note">
              The <strong>Snapshot</strong> takes your credit story and turns it into a game plan:
              which items to attack first, what letters to use, and which laws back you up.
